## How to use the level loader


#### 1. Specify where your cmdline.txt is (If you don't know what cmdline.txt is, refer to [How to dump Epic Mickey](https://github.com/KjubDusJub/Epic-Mickey-Level-Loader/tree/master#how-to-dump-epic-mickey))

#### 2. At this point, you can select a level from either the quick access panel or the full list and press "save cmdline.txt"

#### 3. After that find the location of your main.dol file ([Find main.dol](https://github.com/KjubDusJub/Epic-Mickey-Level-Loader/tree/master#1-find-where-your-maindol-file-is-located))

#### 4. Open Dolphin

#### Assign the main.dol file

### Enjoy!

## (OPTIONAL)

  

If you want to get into the game quicker, you can specify where your Dolphin.exe & main.dol files are. If you do this, getting into the game is as easy as clicking one button.

#### 1. Find where your main.dol file is located

The main.dol file is relatively easy to find. Go to the directory where you dumped your EM Files. When clicking on the DATA folder in the directory, you should see three folders.

Click on the sys folder.

And if there were no corruptions while dumping the files, you should see a main.dol file

#### 2. Find where your cmdlist.txt is

If you followed the [How to dump Epic Mickey](https://github.com/KjubDusJub/Epic-Mickey-Level-Loader/tree/master#how-to-dump-epic-mickey) tutorial, then you probably know where this file is, but if you don't, back out of the sys folder and head into the files folder. scroll down slightly, and you should see the cmdlist.txt file

#### 3. Find where your Dolphin.exe is
This one is a little hard to help with, but go into the directory and locate the "Dolphin.exe" file if you know where your Dolphin installation is.
If not, install a new version of Dolphin from https://dolphin-emu.org/download/?ref=btn

### 3. Assign the paths to the level loader

#### 1. Open the application

#### 2. Click on the "Set main.dol" button

#### 3. Assign your cmdline.txt file

#### 4. Assign your Dolphin.exe file

And you're finished!
Click on a level you want to play and click on "save and play"

## How to dump Epic Mickey

### 1. Open Dolphin

### 2. If you haven't yet. Add the folder where your EM ISO is to Dolphin
If you have not assigned a ROM/ISO folder to Dolphin, it's probably time to do so. Left-click in the middle of the application, and you should see a folder select menu.

Find the directory to your Epic Mickey ISO.

Assign it

And now you should see Epic Mickey or some other games if you had other ISO's in the folder.

### 3. Right-click on Epic Mickey in Dolphin
